# Fake-News-Detection-System
Fake News Detection System

This project is a Fake News Detection App built using Streamlit and Logistic Regression. The model predicts whether a given news title is Real or Fake based on text analysis.


Features

Simple and user-friendly Streamlit UI for news classification

TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction

Logistic Regression Model trained on a labeled dataset

81% accuracy on test data

Tech Stack

Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Scikit-Learn for machine learning

Streamlit for web app UI

Pickle for model storage

Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/PNBisaleri/fake-news-detection-system.git

2️⃣ Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the Streamlit app

streamlit run app.py

How It Works

Train Model: Run train_model.py to train and save the model.

Use App: Enter a news title in the text box and click "Check".

Get Prediction: The app will classify the news as Real (✅) or Fake (❌).


Model Performance

Accuracy: 81%

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
